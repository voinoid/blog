## Question 9

<table className="border-collapse">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="2">A closed rectangular box has to be constructed as follows:<ul>
          <li>Dimensions: length $(l)$, width $(w)$ and height $(h)$.</li>
          <li>The length $(l)$ of the base has to be $3$ times its width $(w)$.</li>
          <li>The volume has to be $5\,m^3$ .</li></ul>The material for the top and the bottom parts costs $R15$ per square metre and the material for the sides costs $R6$ per square metre.</td>
          <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$9.1$</td>
      <td>Show that the cost to construct the box can be calculated by: $Cost=90w^2+48wh$</td>
      <td>$(4)$</td>
    </tr> 
    <tr>
      <td>$9.2$</td>
      <td>Determine the width of the box such that the cost to build the box is a minimum.</td>
