      <td>Two friends, Kuda and Thabo, each want to invest $R5\,000$ for four years. Kuda invests his money in an account that pays simples interest at $8,3\%$ per annum. At the end of four years, he will receive a bonus of exactly $4\%$ of the accumulated amount. Thabo invests his money in an account that pays interest at $8\%$ p.a., compounded monthly.</td>

Instead, the bank advised Mandy that the extra amount repaid every month could be regarded as an investment and that she could withdraw this full amount to fund her daughter's studies. Calculate the maximum amount that Mandy may withdraw from the loan account.</td>
