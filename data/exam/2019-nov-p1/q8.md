## Question 8

<table className="border-collapse">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="3">After flying a short distance, an insect came to rest on a wall. Thereafter the insect started crawling on the wall. The path that the insect crawled can be described by $h(t)=(t-6)(-2t^2+3t-6)$, where $h$ is the height (in cm) above the floor and $t$ is the time (in minutes) since the insect started crawling.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$8.1$</td>
      <td>At what height above the floor did the insect start to crawl?</td>
      <td>$(1)$</td>
    </tr> 
    <tr>
      <td>$8.2$</td>
      <td>How many times did the insect reach the floor?</td>
      <td>$(3)$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$8.3$</td>
      <td>Determine the maximum height that the insect reached above the floor.</td>
      <td>$(4)$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td>$\textbf{[8]}$</td>
