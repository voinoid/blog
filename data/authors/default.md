I am currently working as the lead data scientist for a property company in Berlin.

I hold a masters in electrical engineering, and wondered my way into data science through
various online courses. As an engineer at heart, my interests lie in the application of
data and machine learning to solve real problems.

This blog is new and I hope to write some articles about some of my interests over the coming months.

# interests

The world is a complex place. I break things down into useful, actionable insights.

## climate change

### renewable energy

What are the most effective approaches to integrate renewable energy into the power grid.

### regenerative agriculture

I am a firm believer that nature knows best, but can use some help from us along the way.

How can we use technology in combination with regenerative agriculture to feed the planet and help solve climate change?

## health

Without health, one has nothing. A healthy person has many problems, an unhealthy person has just one.

### lifespan

Discovering simple rules that one can take to maximise healthspan and reduce healthcare costs.

### sports

Exercise is a necessity to life and mental well being.
I have cycled many kilometers, run many miles and lifted many weights.

### mental wellbeing

What things can one do to stay mentally sane, reduce anxiety and stress?
