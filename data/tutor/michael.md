## About

I offer my enthusiasm and experience towards **Mathematics Tutoring**. I have 3 years of experience teaching within a classroom environment. This has allowed me to work closely with a large variety of learners and ways of thinking. I believe that my teaching expereince can help you to determine which Mathematical building blocks require additional attention. We can then work together in building a stable Mathematical foundation. I place a strong emphasis on understanding before answering specific types of questions; however, I still understand the importance of results in your Final Matric Exams. I look forward to talking more about Mathematics with you!

## Qualifications
