Leaders come in many forms and have different beliefs, values, and cultures. This post breaks down some of the high-level differences among leaders and highlights what one should be aware of in a leadership role.

# leadership development

## nature versus nurture

Are leaders made or born? 

There are two dominant theories of leadership: entity theory, also known as trait theory and incremental theory

Entity theory argues that leadership is a trait, that one is born with. Incremental theory argues that one can learn to be a leader. I personally subscribe to the incremental theory of leadership. One can be born with certain traits that make one more naturally inclined to become a leader, but leadership skills can be grown and developed through hard work.

## mindset and growth

Do you have a growth or fixed mindset? Do you believe that you can change who you are and improve your skills with work and practice or do you believe that you are who you are and anything you are good or bad at must stay that way? That is the difference between a fixed and growth mindset.

Growth mindsets are much more successful long term and should be nurtured in yourself and others. People with fixed mindsets don't like trying new things because the risk of failure implies that they aren't good enough. In contrast, people who have a growth mindset, see themselves and others as having potential. New things present an opportunity to learn and grow.

Have a growth mindset!

## leadership styles

There are two main theories of leadership styles. Theory X leadership and Theory Y leadership.

Theory X leadership is mostly transactional. You do something and I'll give you a reward at the end, like a carrot dangling in front of a rabbit.

Theory Y leadership is based upon the idea that people want to contribute and do excellent work.

In my view, one needs to combine these leadership styles. People should be sufficiently rewarded monetarily, especially when they are contributing significantly to your own or the company's profits. However, the reward should not be the thing that motivates them to work for you. The reward should be a by-product of the intrinsic motivation to do something useful and meaningful.
