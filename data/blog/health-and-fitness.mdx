This post is a summary about what works for me, what I have tried and what I have learned regarding health and fitness.

I intend to update this as I learn more and use it to increase my accountability.
As the old saying goes, _‚ÄùWe know that half of what we know about health is wrong, we just don't know which half."_

While I am no athlete or health professional, I have absorbed significant amounts of health-related books and podcasts. The bits below are the points that have stood out.

# eating

I have tried keto, paleo, and intermittent fasting.

Of all three, I felt the best eating keto, but found it unsustainable.

In the end, I have naturally tended towards a mix of intermittent fasting and paleo.
This combo ended up being the best mix for me, without being too strict about it.
I try to orient my diet to be fat heavy while limiting the amount of carbs.

This usually means I skip breakfast.
Instead, I have either a bulletproof coffee, or a coffee with a significant amount of cream.

I love eating veggies soaked in fat such as butter or olive oil.

The fats I try to limit myself to are:

- butter
- olive oil
- coconut oil

Aim to eat less, high quality food rather than lot's of low quality junk.

# don't drink too much

Alcohol is a bad idea.

# barefoot shoes

I have used barefoot shoes since 2012.
The transition took about a year before I could use them for all my activities.

Honestly, there is no going back to regular shoes once you switch.

_Once you go barefoot, there is no going back._

Barefoot shoes have eliminated the knee pain I used to develop while running.
After running a couple of marathons in them, I have only had pain in my muscles from being tired.

Other benefits that I have noticed include:

- developed legs of steel
- improved posture
- improved balance

One also develops a mental connection to the ground.
You get so much more sensory input, that after a while you feel lost without this additional data point.

Here are three frequent questions I get about wearing barefoot shoes:

**Q. Aren't you slower while running? Professional athletes don't use barefoot shoes.**

A: Maybe I am slower. But I am not a professional athlete with naturally perfect running form.
In my case the benefits outweigh drawbacks.
If I want to run a faster time, I should train harder.
At any rate, my marathon times can improve substantially before I need the minor speed increase of advanced running shoes.
What is probably true for most people: _It's not the shoes that stop you from running a 2:10 minute marathon._

**Q. Won't you injure yourself? You can't run on the road with no padding.**

A. I have not injured myself once due to using barefoot shoes and running on the road.
On the contrary, I used to injure myself all the time in normal shoes.

**Q. Don't the shoes make you look ridiculous?**

A. Another benefit is that you build mental strength to accept that you look ridiculous.
