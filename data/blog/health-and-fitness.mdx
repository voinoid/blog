This post is a summary about what works for me, what I have tried and what I have learned regarding health and fitness.

I intend to update this as I learn more and use it to increase my accountability. As the old saying goes, ‚ÄùWe _know that half of what we know about health is wrong, we just don't know which half."_

While I am not an athlete or health professional, I have absorbed significant amounts of health-related books and podcasts. The below points have stood out.

# eating

I have tried keto, paleo, and intermittent fasting.

Of all three, I felt the best eating keto, but found it unsustainable.

In the end, I have naturally tended towards a mix of intermittent fasting and paleo.
This combo ended up being the best mix for me, without being too strict about it.
I try to orient my diet to be fat heavy while limiting the amount of carbs.

This usually means I skip breakfast.
Instead, I have either a bulletproof coffee, or a coffee with a significant amount of cream.

I love eating veggies soaked in fat such as butter or olive oil. Avoid oils like sunflower, canola, or soybean at all costs. Don't buy them and avoid products that contain them. Recently I have noticed many products bragging to be "palm oil free". The palm oil is replaced with one of the unhealthy oils and makes the product significantly less healthy.

The fats I limit myself to are:

* butter
* olive oil
* coconut oil

Aim to eat less, high quality food rather than lots of low-quality junk.

# alcohol

Alcohol is one of those things that one usually wants to drink less of. On the short term it affects sleep, reduces motivation, and interrupts your routines. Over the long term the health effects are vast.

I use the app [https://lessdrinks.com/](https://lessdrinks.com/ "Less") to track my alcohol consumption. It is surprisingly easy to forget how much alcohol one consumes, and this acts as a good reminder.

# exercise

I like exercise. Without it, life would be miserable. Sometimes it is not easy. That's what builds the mental toughness required to take on other challenges.

I exercise so that I can do things in normal life without having to worry about if I am capable of it. Exercise is training for life. It allows one to do fun things when the opportunity arises or get out of a tricky situation. If you have done it in training, you can do it when it matters.

The two aspects to work on are endurance and strength. Both need to be worked on simultaneously to build overall fitness. My choices are running and cycling for endurance, and calisthenics and weights for strength.

# barefoot shoes

I have used barefoot shoes since 2012.
The transition took about a year before I could use them for all my activities.

Honestly, there is no going back to regular shoes once you switch.

_Once you go barefoot, there is no going back. - Me_

Barefoot shoes have eliminated the knee pain I used to develop while running.
After running a couple of marathons in them, I have only had pain in my muscles from being tired.

Other benefits that I have noticed include:

* developed legs of steel
* improved posture
* improved balance

One also develops a mental connection to the ground. You get so much more sensory input, that after a while you feel lost without this additional sense.

My favourite brand is Vivobarefoot.

Here are three frequent questions I get about wearing barefoot shoes:

**Q. Aren't you slower while running? Professional athletes don't use barefoot shoes.**

A: I am slower, but I am not a professional athlete with naturally perfect running form. The benefits outweigh drawbacks. If I want to run a faster time, I should train harder. My running times can improve substantially before I need the minor speed increase of advanced running shoes. What is true for most people: _It's not the shoes that stop you from running a 2:10 minute marathon._

**Q. Won't you injure yourself? You can't run on the road with no padding.**

A. I have not injured myself once due to using barefoot shoes and running on the road. On the contrary, I used to injure myself all the time in normal shoes.

If you start slowly, and build up your muscle and tendon strength, your joints will be protected. Run for years without any injuries and recover faster from big events.

**Q. Don't the shoes make you look ridiculous?**

A. Another benefit is that you build the mental strength required to accept that you look ridiculous.
