summary: 'A review of the book Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts.'
---

Recently on a holiday in Turkey, I settled down to read the book _Shantaram_ by Gregory David Roberts.

The book is a work of fiction, but is based roughly on the life of Gregory after his escape from an Australian prison.

The story starts with the main character "Lin", who is on the run, having just arrived in Bombay/Mumbai in the 80's.
Lin ends up living a fascinating life, and experiences the joys and hardships of Mumbai at the time.
It is hard to distinguish where the border lies between fiction and reality.

The descriptions within the book are incredibly detailed, and can easily be read as facts.
These detailed descriptions are most prevalent in the first half of the book.
As the book progresses they increasingly feel dragged out and sometimes one wants just to get to the point.

Overall, the book is a very good read. I recommend it, but be warned that it takes work to get through.
