# introduction

Templates are a quick way to bootstrap a repository for a new project and then keep it up to date with your best practices.

A good template allows you to:

- update all sub projects easily
- get to production quickly
- have a consistent development environment

Templates allow any improvements to be made in one place and then merged into all of the projects that use the template as a base.
They are vital when working in teams.
Nobody likes repeating work many times when you are working on multiple different projects at the same time.

# template repositories

You have two choices when deciding to use templates.

The first, is creating a new repository from a template, without including the git history.
This is effecively a snapspot in the point in time of your template repository.
Any changes you make to the template repository will need to be manually merged into all of the projects that use it.

The second, and the method which I prefer, is to add a template repository as a remote repository on an empty git repo.
The advantage is that you can pull any changes from your template repository into your projects.

# how to use templates

Before we get into the details, let's take a look at how to use templates.

## step one: create a repository

I like to standardise my project names when they are based upon a template.
For example, a project that is based on a template for a machine learning API could be named something like:

`repository-name = <project_name>-ml-api`

where **project_name** is the name of your project.

After deciding on a name, create the repository.
Clone this new repository to your local machine.

## step two: add the template repository as a remote

Follow the following steps to setup the new repository with your template repository as a remote where it is only possible to pull from.

Initially only the new repository origin will be a remote.
You can check this by running the following command:

```bash
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:<organisation>/<project-name>-ml-api.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:<organisation>/<project-name>-ml-api.git (push)
```

We will now add the one of the templates as a remote.

`git remote add upstream git@github.com:<organisation>/template-ml-api.git`

Then we want to ensure you cannot push to this remote.

`git remote set-url --push upstream no_push`

After executing the above commands, you should see the following output:

```bash
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:<organisation>/<project-name>-ml-api.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:<organisation>/<project-name>-ml-api.git (push)
upstream        git@github.com:<organisation>/base-ml-api.git (fetch)
upstream        no_push (push)
```

## step three: start your project with the template

Pull from the template repository and allow you to merge any changes that occurred in the base repository by running the following command:

`git pull upstream master`

Commit any changes and push back to your newly created repository.
Congratulations, you have now created a new repository based on a template.

It should be possible to run `git pull upstream master` to merge any changes in the template into your project in the future.

# what to include in your template

A template repository should include:

- standard env files for your particular setup
- deployment files
- CI/CD templates and scripts
- standard secret names
-

change files for each new project
To use this template in each project, there are files which you will need to change so that
it works with your project. See

In general this include things like project naming, URLS, naming in k8s files and
environment variables.

Some examples include:

in certain situations, you will need to change the base-mal to newname-projectid

docker registry names

secret names

These files include:

deployment/

In these files it is necessary to change the namespace, and naming of the ingresses, service, deployment configmap and secrets etc.

Follow this naming convention

.envs/

secret-names.txt

various env files

az-devops.yaml

Change the variables at the top of the file

az-devops-k8s.yaml

Add the secrets for your project in AzureKeyVault@1 and then the names in displayName: Create secrets task.

The base ones can be used as an example

in general, anything that contains base should be changed to project-name.
