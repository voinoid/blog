Team Contract

Data science team in a residential property company. We provide support to the business to help with operations, customer interactions and property management.

Team Mission:

The data science team goal is to support the business with decision making. For the customer service department, we will handle 50% of the customer queries automatically using our chatbot. For the operations department, we will reduce the time to analyse a property purchase by 10%.

Rules of engagement:

\- Simple is better than complex – don’t use a complicated solution where a simple one will suffice

\- Under-promise and overdeliver – data science is a topic where many people expect magic to happen

\- Demonstrate the value soon – add value as soon as possible without waiting for a perfect solution

\- Turn down projects that don’t make sense – many ideas are cool, but don’t justify the investment

Roles and responsibilities:

TL – Will align requirements and expectations with other teams

DS – Will develop maintainable, reliable models

DE – Will make sure that everyone has access to standardized clean data

DV – Will develop stable API’s and update other teams with changes
